This is a request for ALL Embarcadero Lofts association records received/produced/acquired in the month of {{ month }} {{ year }} or
any other documents that have been received/produced/acquired over the past year that have not been previously provided.

You have 10 business days to comply.  For any documents for this time period that arrive after the next 10 business days,
they will be produced in the next monthly request to follow.

Association Records include, but are not limited to:
- Ledgers
- Budgets
- Financial Reports
- Account Lists and Statements
- Meeting Minutes
- Invoices
- Copies of Checks
- Contracts
- Insurance Packages

Purpose:

This board has repeatedly and persistently breached their fiduciary duties, through neglect and/or willful intent, 
engaged in gross conflicts of interests and self-serving conduct, and have consistently placed their loyalties in vendors
over the membership. Previous record requests have resulted in disturbing findings, and have demonstrated that this board
cannot be trusted. Since this board insists on engaging in this conduct and schemes, I'm going to insist on collecting 
and cataloging evidence against them and their collaborating vendors and reporting my findings to appropriate audiences.
